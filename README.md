# The Red and Blue Chair is a chair designed in 1917 by Gerrit Rietveld. It represents one of the first explorations by the De Stijl art movement in three dimensions. We built a model of the red and blue chair based on 2D images for the audience to observe and experience the structure and details of this famous chair
